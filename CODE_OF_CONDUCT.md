# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to building and maintaining a welcoming, respectful, and collaborative community. Every person who participates in this project — whether by writing code, reporting issues, suggesting ideas, or engaging in discussions — deserves to be treated with dignity and consideration.

## Our Values

This community is guided by the following principles:

- **Respect**: We treat every participant with courtesy, regardless of their background, experience level, identity, or perspective.
- **Inclusion**: We actively seek to create an environment where diverse voices are heard and valued.
- **Collaboration**: We prioritize constructive dialogue, shared learning, and collective progress over individual ego.
- **Empathy**: We assume good intentions and approach disagreements with patience and understanding.
- **Professionalism**: We hold ourselves to a high standard of conduct in all project spaces.

## Expected Behavior

- Communicate with kindness and professionalism
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Accept constructive feedback gracefully
- Focus on what is best for the community and the project
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences

## Unacceptable Behavior

Any behavior that undermines the safety, dignity, or well-being of others is unacceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
- Disrespectful, demeaning, or exclusionary language
- Personal attacks or hostile commentary
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Any conduct that would reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces — including issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other communication channel associated with this project. It also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at **security@zombie-escape-online.com**. All reports will be reviewed promptly and handled with discretion and confidentiality.

Maintainers reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions that violate this Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently restrict participation for anyone whose behavior is deemed harmful to the community.
